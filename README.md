# 🖐️ TORA – Touchless Operating Room Assistant

An AI-powered real-time gesture recognition system built to enable **sterile, hands-free interaction** for surgeons during operations. TORA allows safe navigation of medical data (MRI scans, reports, EHR) using predefined gestures, eliminating the need for physical contact in high-risk surgical environments.
